// explain the difference between getBy, findBy, queryBy:
// get by is for normal getting data and if had no data it will throw an error
// in find by we use it for asyncrounes part of component like fetching data or somthing like that takes time to rerender the component
// the only different between get and query is inestead of error this query if didn't find that element it going to return null
